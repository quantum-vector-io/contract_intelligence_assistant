# Contract Intelligence Assistant - Local Development Mode
# This script sets up the local development environment with Docker OpenSearch and local FastAPI/Streamlit

# Start development environment
#.\windows_dev_mode.ps1

# Stop all services
#.\windows_dev_mode.ps1 -StopOnly

# Start without health checks (faster)
#.\windows_dev_mode.ps1 -NoHealthCheck

# üéØ What the Script Does:
# Validates Environment: Checks if venv and Docker are available
# Cleans Up: Stops any existing services
# Starts Docker: docker-compose up -d opensearch opensearch-dashboards
# Starts Backend: .\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
# Starts Frontend: .\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run src\ui\app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.headless true
# Health Checks: Verifies all services are responding correctly
# Status Report: Shows URLs and helpful commands

# üîß Additional Commands:
# The script provides helpful development commands at the end:

# View backend/frontend logs: Get-Job | Receive-Job
# View Docker logs: docker-compose logs -f opensearch
# Stop everything: .[windows_dev_mode.ps1](http://_vscodecontentref_/3) -StopOnly
#
# function prompt { "(venv) PS $(Split-Path -Leaf $PWD)> " } - make your power shell prompt simpler ( just for dev manual mode )
